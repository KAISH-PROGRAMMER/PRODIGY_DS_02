SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number

Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

Step 2: Data Cleaning
Data cleaning involves:
Handling missing values
Correcting data types
Removing duplicates
Addressing outliers

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves:
Descriptive statistics
Data visualization
Identifying relationships between variables
